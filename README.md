# AB-Test
##### The two files analyze same dataset, one using R-Studio, and another using Python.
##### The problem of these projects are trying to test the impact of a new product page, designed by a company, on the effectiveness of customer purchase. Company providing this data has a product page which has conversion rate of 13%, and management wants to increase the rate to 15% by doing some minor changes in the product page, thereby creating a new page. So, these projects are checking if there is at least 2% statistical difference between the two page. Both analysis rejected the effectiveness of the new page by performing a simple ab-test. Both codes in R & Python are included in the folder, the codes/analysis in Python are as follows:

# 1) AB-Test in Python:
